# Azure AI-900 Exam Notes / Preparation Repository

## Purpose

This repository is designed to assist you in preparing for the AI-900 exam. Unlike other exams, this one is relatively straightforward if you thoroughly understand the content covered in the official [learning paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-900). Utilizing practice questions helped me pass the exam on my first attempt. [Verify my certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/anxkhn/credentials/60e4a16a343378da).

**Official Website:** [Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals)

**Official Study Material:** [Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals)

**Practice Tests:** [Official, Free, Recommended](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-practice-for-the-exam)

I have been exploring a lot of resources for the AI-900 exam, especially to cram for it, and I have compiled a list of resources that I found helpful. I found banks of questions which were behind a paywall ranging from $5 to $75. I don't think it's needed. I compiled a list of questions from the web and the official practice tests myself, and I am providing it to you for free. Don't pay for any services online. You can pass this exam with the resources I have provided.

## Preparation Strategy 2024

**Preparation time:** 1-2 weeks, depending on your current knowledge of AI and Azure.

The Azure AI-900 exam has evolved over the years, with recent additions such as Generative AI, making it essential to prepare accordingly.

### Recommended Strategy

3. **Practice Previous Exam Questions:** These resources will provide a good understanding of the exam questions, which are not limited to multiple-choice questions. I highly recommend reviewing these:

## My Outcome

I took CS50 AI, AI and DS as part of my academic degree and learned a lot from online resources as a self-learner. Therefore, it was easy for me to cram and score 871/100, surpassing the passing score of 700. Although I didn't go through the official learning path, I did review the official practice tests and the questions from my notes.
